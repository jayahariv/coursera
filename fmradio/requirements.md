# FM Radio Receiver - Requirements

We will be building an FM Radio Receiver, which has some basic functionalities similar like a pocket FM radio. 

## User should be able to: 
1. Connect the device to AC power via adapter.
2. Change the FM Frequency(with a predefined interval rate). For example ability to change frequency from 99.1 to 99.2, with a predeined interval 0.1. 
3. See which Frequency is tuned into via a small display. 
4. Could hear the sound via a speaker.
5. Control the FM Radio via mobile bluetooth. Control includes, 
  5.1 Tuning
  5.2 Add favorite channels and play them


## Contraints
1. FM Frequency range 88.0MHz to 108MHz as per USA.
2. No concern whether it has Volume control or not.
3. No concern whether the radio has inbuilt favorite channel buttons. 
4. No concern about an additional fine tuner for frequency(which are common in FM Radios). 
5. Cost: $50-$100
6. Time: less than 2 weeks.
